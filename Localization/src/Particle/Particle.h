*   @Info   - This is the declaration of the Particle class, a class that is used extensively by the 3DLocalization program. This class is declared inside
*           of this file and defined inside of Particle.cpp. The Particle class will be used to represent a single guess as to where our robot could be in 
            the environment. This 'guess' data structure will contain general data about the perspective
