    \begin{abstract}
    This is the official documentation for a series of interconnected programs written at Harvey Mudd during the summer of 2014 by John Allard and Alex Rich. The purpose of these programs is to successfully localize an actor in an environment using a preloaded 3D map, precomputed computer-vision related feature data, and a live image feed from an actor in the environment. The program starts with a large amount of guesses as to where the actor could be, and uses particle filtering to converge the particles upon the correct location in the environment. Read the research paper associated with this project for more information on the mathematics and other technicalities behind Monte Carlo Localization.

    \section{Introduction}
    Accomplishing the task of successfully locating an actor in an environment using CV-derived features and a 3D model requires many individual steps. The success of the localization attempt depends strongly on the computation and data storage that is done before any attempt is made. With this in mind, we decided to subdivide the task of localizing an actor into a few separate programs that must be run individually. Two of them are done before the localization attempt and are only needed to be ran once for each map that an actor is attempting to localize itself in. The other group of programs are used for the actual localization attempt. This includes the actual 3DLocalization program and some optional GUI programs used for debugging and data-visualization purposes.

        \subsection{Pre-Localization Programs Overview}
	This section will give a brief overview of the programs that need to be run prior to an attempt at localizing an actor in an environment.
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item PerspectiveGenerator
            \begin{itemize}
            \item Takes an input file that specifies a user-supplied 3D model, the bounding box on the model, and some other information as input. 
            \item Generates a grid within that bounding box at a user defined spacing, and makes a list of every grid intersection.
            \item Renders \texttt{[600x600]} images from every point enumerated in the list and saves them into the \texttt{/Data/RenderedImages/} directory.
            \item Has been tested with \texttt{Wavefront .obj} model files, should work with other types of files.
            \item The structure for the input file necessary to run this program is discussed in section 2 of this paper.
            \item On a decent (by no means fast) computer it renders images at about 20 per second, so if you need to render 5000 images (as our group had to), it's going to take a little while. We did not have the available time to optimize this program.
            \end{itemize}
        \item DatabaseGenerator
            \begin{itemize}
            \item Takes the name of a model directory inside of \texttt{/Data/RenderedImages/} that contains the rendered images from the model that the user would like to generate feature data for as a command line argument.
            \item Generates a database of computer-vision related feature data from the images rendered by the \texttt{PerspectiveGenerator} program.
            \item This program does the majority of the work and is the reason this Localization program can run efficiently in real time, it computes mounds of data using many different types of computer vision algorithms. It then organizes and writes all of this data to the \texttt{/Data/FeatureData/} directory for use by the Localization program.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{enumerate}

        \subsection{Localization Programs Overview}
        This section will give a brief overview of the program directly involved in the localization attempt, as well as some optional-to-run programs to expand our testing and data-visualization capabilities.
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item 3DLocalization Program
            \begin{itemize}
            \item The purpose of this program is to use the data generated by the \texttt{PerspectiveGenerator} and \texttt{DatabaseGenerator} program to localize an actor in real-time. 
            \item This program starts by loading the data from the \texttt{3DLocalization/Data/FeatureData/} directory into live variables. The most computationally expensive of these processes is generating a master map that returns feature data given a certain perspective in the map.
            \item Establish a connection with the robot/actor :
              \begin{enumerate}
              \item Then it begins publishing data under our \texttt{ros::Publisher} object and waits for the robot control program to subscribe to this publisher.
              \item When a subscriber is detected, a handshake code is sent out over our data publisher, letting the robot know that we are ready to begin the  localization process.
              \item Next, the localization program searches for the robots data publisher and subscribes to it when found. This connection will allow our algorithm to know the movement of the robot and other information to help in the localization process.
             \end{enumerate}
            \item Begin the main localization loop :
              \begin{enumerate}
                \item Generate a uniform distribution of particles over the map area, each particle represent a guess as to where the actor is.
                \item Take in a sensor reading from the robot in the form of an image. Process the image to extract feature data.
                \item Weigh the particles, generate a distribution according to the particle grouping and weighting.
                \item Sample from the distribution for new particles.
                \item Move the robot to a new location and move the particles a corresponding distance in the map.
              \end{enumerate}
            \item Iterate the loop from bullet 4 to 7.
            \end{itemize}
         \item TestRobot Program
	    \begin{itemize}
	     \item This program is designed to act as a `virtual` robot to aid in the testing and demonstration of our localization program. It acts the same as a regular robot control program except it traverses the virtual 3D model of the environment as send rendered images to our localization program instead of acting in the real 3D environment.
	    \end{itemize}
	 \item GUI Programs
	   \begin{enumerate}
	   \item PyViewer Program
	      \begin{itemize}
	      \item Visualizes the particles in the current map from a `birds eye view`. Displays their position and orientation in the map and colors them in a heat-map style according to their probability of being the correct location for the robot.
	      \item Mainly used for debugging purposes and to generate images for slides and posters.
	      \end{itemize}
	   \item MapViewer Program
	      \begin{itemize}

%==== Section 2, Perspective Generator === %
    \section{Perspective Generator}

        \subsection{Overview}
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item General Purpose - The general purpose of this program is to convert a 3D model into a processable library of images that are rendered from 
        different points in the model. This serves the purpose of allowing us to use existing 2D-Image feature detection algorithms 
        (like Sped-Up Robust Feature Detection, or Scale Invariant Feature Detection) to match a 2D image feed from an actor to a point in a 3D model.
        \item Dependencies - OpenGL 3.3, GLEW, GLUT, BOOST 1.46, OpenCV.
        \end{enumerate}
        
        \subsection{Program Flow}
	\begin{enumerate}
	 \item Before you can run the program, you must first build it by going into the \texttt{/PerspectiveGenerator/build/} directory and entering
	 \texttt{cmake ..} then \texttt{ make }.
	 This will generate a runnable file called \\ \texttt{./PerspectiveGenerator} inside of the same directory. 
	 \item Create a directory containing your 3D model, \texttt{.mtl} files, and texture files. Create a new directory with a meaningful name in the \texttt{/3DLocalizer/Data/ModelData/} directory. Name this directory something meaningful because you will need to pass in this directory name as input to a few programs in this project.
	 \item You will then need to hand type an input file for the program, and place it in the \\ \texttt{PerspectiveGenerator/Inpufiles/} directory. This file must contain the following, line by line.
	  \begin{itemize}
	  \item Name of the directory containing your 3D model file inside of the  \texttt{/3DLocalizer/Data/ModelData/} directory.
	  \item Name of the 3D model file inside the above folder (e.g.\texttt{ dog.obj}).
	  \item Bounding box for your 3D model in the following format : \\ \texttt{xmin xmax ymin ymax z gridDensity dtheta}.
	  \end{itemize} 
	As you can see, the height z must be kept contant for this program. This will hopefully be changed in the future. The gridDensity value determines the spacing between consecutive image renderings, it should be in units according to the scale of your 3D model, not the real life space that the actor is in. The dTheta detemines the angle we rotate by when generated images from a single point with different perspectives (e.g. a value of 30 degrees will cause the program to render 12 images at \texttt{0, 30, 60, ..} degrees from every \texttt{[x y z]} point on the grid.
	\item From the \texttt{/PerspectiveGenerator/build/} folder, call the \texttt{./PerspectiveGenerator} executable and pass in the name of the input file as an argument.
	\item The program will take 10 seconds or so to load, when it does you will see a window with a rendering from a single point in the map. 
	\item Click anywhere on the screen and the program will automatically go through all points generated inside your map and render images to the
	  \texttt{/Data/RenderedImages/} folder under the same name of your folder containing the model data.
	\item When the program stops scrolling through the images (at about 20-25 per second), you can close the program.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsection{Issues and Fixes}
	  \begin{enumerate}
	  \item Very Important : The .vert and .frag Shader files must have the same name before the extension. This took me like 2-3 days to figure out and I did not see it anywhere inside the documentation for OpenGL.
          \item The program will only work on more modern OpenGL version. Go to console and type \texttt{glxinfo | grep "OpenGL version"} to find out which version is currently running on your computer. If it is not 3.3 exactly, this program might not run correctly. It would be useful to fix this but it's too lengthy of a process to concentrate on currently.
          \item The 3D models are not normalized or scaled to proper real world scale. So 0.1 distance in the model might be 3 or 4 foot change in real life. So the program needs to have the \texttt{scale} variable adjusting according to each new model that the user tries to use.
          \item Sometimes this program runs unbelievably slow for a short while, while it normally runs at a pretty decent rate. I think it has something to do with the older workstation I'm using, it almost seems as if some of the time it is attempting to use the CPU to do the graphics computations.
          \item It is inconvenient to force the program to render to the window and then take the image from the window to render to the file, and this is obviously not the best programming practice. However, this program was merely seen as a stepping stone to the goal of localizaing a robot and I happen to be quite new to OpenGL, so we had to take version of this program that actually worked.

%==== Section 3, Database Generator === %
\section{Database Generator}
  \subsection{Overview}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Purpose - Creates a directory full of feature data to accompany each photo created by the Perspective Generator. 
    \item Dependencies - OpenCV, Boost 1.46.
    \end{enumerate}
    
  \subsection{Program Flow}
    \begin{enumerate}
     \item Navigate to the \texttt{PreLocalization/DatabaseGen/build/} folder via the terminal.
     \item Type \texttt{ cmake .. } followed by \texttt{ make } to build the program. If error messages appear, check in \emph{Section 3.3, Issues and Fixes} for more information. If nothing is there, feel free to open up a bug reguest on Github.
     \item From the same \texttt{/build/} folder, type \texttt{./CreateDB yourModelNameHere}, where \texttt{yourModelNameHere} is replaced by the name of the directory that contains your 3D model data inside of the \texttt{3DLocalization/Data/ModelData/} directory.
     \item Press enter and the program will run. It will start by loading the images from the \texttt{3DLocalization/Data/RenderedImages/} directory from file into active memory. A terminal message will be displayed when this is finished (can take up to a few minutes to load 10,000 images).
     \item The program will loop through each image and calculate a set of feature data for each image, the set of feature data contains the following :
       \begin{itemize}
        \item Features derived from the Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) algorithm. 
        \item Feaures derived from the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm.
        \item Average Pixel Sum Image: Take original image, split into divisions, then for each grid square, take the average pixel intensity. This grayscale image is small, around 50x50.
        \item Above Below Image: Take the average intensity of the Average Pixel Sum Image. If a pixel in that image is lighter, make it white. If it's darker, make it black. This image is the same size as the Pixel Sum Image but is binary.
       \end{itemize}
     \item These features will be written to file inside of the \texttt{/3DLocalization/Data/FeatureData/} directory under a folder with the same as the directory containing the 3D model data. The individual files that are written will consist of \texttt{.jpg} and \texttt{.yml} file, and the name will be the \texttt{[x y z dx dy dz} coordinates of the perspective that the feature data corresponds to.
     \item A progress bar will be displayed via the terminal letting you know how long the process will take. It has taken us 17 minutes to compute and store the feature data corresponding to 6500 rendered \texttt{[600x600]} images.

    \end{enumerate}

%==== Section 4, 3DLocalizer === %
\section{3D Localization}

  %=== Subsection 4.1, 3DLocalization Overview ===%
  \subsection{Localization Program Overview}
  As described earlier, this program is the one that actually uses the Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) algorithm and computer-vision derived feature data to localize an actor in an environment.
  As also was described earlier, this program can only be ran after all of the pre-localization requirements have been met\footnote{For more information on these, see sections 2 and 3.}.
  \\ An abstract description of this program would be the following :
  \\ \texttt{1.) Load data necessary to localize the actor and generate guesses about the actors position.} 
  \\ \texttt{2.) Loop through the MCL algorithm until your guesses converge on a location}

  The coding goal of this program was to use practices that are generally accepted to be good\footnote{Practices like Object Oriented Programming, no jump points, proper naming conventions, and inline code documentation}.
  This means abstracting the problem of localizing a robot into a series of classes and a series of independent functions. We also had to make decisions about adding a GUI
  to the program, or which libraries we wanted to use for callback functionality. Our solutions to the problems will be documented and illustrated in the following sections.
  
  %=== Subsection 4.2, Directory Tree ===%
  \subsection{Program Flow}
  This section will only provide an overview of how the program runs and will avoid the technical details. A more detailed description of the parts of this program are discussed later in this document.

     \begin{itemize}
       \item Ensure that you have all dependencies listed in \emph{Section 4.3, Building the Program}.

       \item Enter \texttt{cmake ..} follow by \texttt{make} into the terminal to build the program.
       \item If any errors appear in the previous steps please see the \emph{Errors and Issues} section.
     \end{itemize}
   \item Starting the Program
     \begin{itemize}
       \item Ensure that your actor has its main control sequence started and that is it publishing image information via a \texttt{ROS::publisher}.
       \item Navigate to the \texttt{/Localization/build/} directory via the terminal, and type \texttt{./Localize}, this will run the programs executable.

              \item \texttt{Controller.cpp} - Definition of the functionality defined in \texttt{Controller.h}.
            \end{itemize}
          \item \texttt{Matching/}
            \begin{itemize}
              \item \texttt{Matching.h} - A file that holds functions that compute relations between different images using computer vision algorithms (e.g. SURF, SIFT).
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
      \item \texttt{Main/}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \texttt{Main.cpp} - The official starting point of the program. Calls the boot functions, initializes the Controller class, and starts the main localization loop.
        \end{itemize}
      \item \texttt{Particle/}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \texttt{Particle.h} - Declaration of the \texttt{Particle} class. This data structure represents a single guess as to where the robot could currently be in the environment. 
          \item \texttt{Particle.cpp} - Definition of all of the functionality declared in the \texttt{Particle} class.
        \end{itemize}
      \item \texttt{Robot/}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \texttt{RobotState.h} - Declaration for the \texttt{RobotState} class. This class holds a model of a general robot and functions to do work on the model. 
          \item \texttt{RobotState.cpp} - Implementation of the \texttt{RobotState} class.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \texttt{/Localization/TestRobot/} - 
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{main.cpp} - The entire control program for the test robot. Contains the callback functions and the main function.
        \item \texttt{package.xml} - Package to build ROS dependencies for the test robot.
      \end{itemize}

    \item \texttt{/Localization/build/} - Contains build files for the program. Will contain a .gitignore to ignore any build files from being pushed to the repository. 

    \item \texttt{/Localization/README.md} - Quick breakdown of the 3DLocalization program.

    \item \texttt{/Localization/CMakeLists.txt} - Tells CMake how to create the program and link dependencies.
